## 🛠 Tools & Tech  
- **Power BI** – data modeling, DAX, Power Query  
- **GitHub** – version control & deployment  
- **Dataset** – European Fashion Store (Kaggle)  

---

## 💡 Mistakes & Fixes (Learning Points)  
- Tried linking Campaigns table directly to Sales Items → caused many-to-many errors, so I removed that relationship.  
- Dataset covered only 3 months → focused analysis on **short-term performance trends** instead of long-term forecasting.  
- Removed low-value columns (e.g., Gender, Brand) → improved clarity in data modeling.

- Cleaning and transforming raw data.  
- Building **interactive dashboards** for different audiences.  
- Troubleshooting common modeling issues (like many-to-many relationships).  
- Designing visuals that balance **clarity and storytelling**.
