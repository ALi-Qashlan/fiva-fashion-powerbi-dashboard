# Fiva-Fashion-Powerbi-Dashboard
I built this 3-page Power BI dashboard to analyze sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends for Fiva Fashion.
Sales Overview: KPIs (revenue, profit, orders, AOV) and sales trends.
Customer Insights: Demographics, spending patterns, and top countries.
Product Insights & Drillthrough: Best-performing categories and customer-level order details.
Challenges solved:
Attempted to connect the Campaigns table to Sales Items, but this caused many-to-many issues. I decided to exclude campaigns and focus on clean, reliable sales and customer insights.
Adjusted analysis for a short 3-month dataset.
Removed redundant columns for a cleaner model.
The result: an interactive dashboard that highlights performance drivers and supports smarter decisions.
